# WordsWordsWords
This game is a hangman remake. Throughout the game, you will be given several letters you must find. You will have six attempts per letter, to find the right letters. Once you have found all the correct letters, guess the correct word using the letter you found earlier. Once you have guessed the right word the screen will automatically give you the definition so you can slowly learn as you go.
